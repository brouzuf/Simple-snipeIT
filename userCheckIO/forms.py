class LoginForm(forms.Form):
    # Using a generic username field; Snipe-IT might use email or username.
    # For now, this form doesn't directly use these fields to get a token,
    # as we're using a pre-configured token. This form is a placeholder
    # for a more traditional login flow if requirements change.
    # We'll "log in" by verifying the pre-configured token.
    # If a user needs to enter their *own* Snipe-IT username/password
    # or their *own* API token, this form and the view logic would need
    # to be significantly different (e.g. actually POSTing to Snipe-IT's login).
    # For now, we'll just have a "Login" button that triggers the check
    # of the pre-configured token.
    pass # No fields needed for now as we use a pre-configured token.
         # A button in the template will trigger the login.
